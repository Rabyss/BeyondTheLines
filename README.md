Our awesome analysis project

## Features ##

### Text level ###

Given a text, compute the following statistics:

* Polarity (positive<->negative)
* Subjectivity (subjective<->objective)
* Level of language
* Semantic fields
* Number of words per sentence

### Webpage level ###

Do the same on the level of a webpage.

### Comparisons ###

Compare text statistics between:
* Several texts
* Several webpages

* Several topics on a website. For example, discover is a website is partial and/or particularly negative towards a topic. The statistics for each topic can be obtained by averaging over search results.
* Several websites, where the statistics of each website are obtained by averaging over most accessed pages.

## Ideas of applications ##

* Compare the views of political parties/candidates/newspapers, their level of language and semantic fields.
